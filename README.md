# Game-Of-War

# Getting Started
Simply pop open a browser of your choice and load into the console.
Once you're in the console you will see the game logged out!

# The log

Everytime a round is completed a console log will pass through. Here you will see the stats. At the end of the game you will see the final "charts" so to speak.
