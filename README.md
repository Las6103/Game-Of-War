# What is War?
Two players start the game by splitting a deck of 52 standard playing cards evenly. Each stack is facedown, and players cannot look at the cards in their stack or rearrange them.
The objective of the game is to play until one player has all 52 cards in their stack. (Stole this from GA repo)

# Getting Started
Simply pop open a browser of your choice(NO IE) and load up the index.html file. Open the console and you will see the game logged out!

# The log

Everytime a round is completed a console log will pass through. Here you will see the stats. At the end of the game you will see the final "charts" so to speak.
